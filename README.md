# Flash Time
Independently created capstone app for Udacity iOS developer nanodegree

Take advantage of a scheduled, spaced-repetition algorithm that will help you learn any subject matter with flash cards.

Just design these flash cards in the editor and let Flash Time take care of when you should study the card.  Each time you answer a flash card, Flash Time gives you options for how well you did.  Did you get it right?  Was it really easy?  Did you feel it was hard?  Were you completely lost?  Flash Time adjusts its algorithm to remind you to study harder ones sooner and pushes easy ones out further in the future.

A distinguishing feature of Flash Time from any other flash card program is that it makes it easy to find and collect public images (or from your photo library) and make that image associate with a flash card.  For example, foreign language flash cards can have a visual cue to its card that can help stimulate your memories for a particular word.
